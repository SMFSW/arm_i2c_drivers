<li>APDS99xx: use of config bits (instead of Status register ones) to trigger proper interrupt(s) clear function</li>
<li>AT42QT1244: renaming of bitfield bit DEBUG in <a class="el" href="../../d6/df5/unionu_a_t42_q_t___r_e_g_____s_e_t_u_p__238.html">uAT42QT_REG__SETUP_238</a> (potential compilation issue, DEBUG symbol being defined in some latest STM32 HAL)</li>

<li>added a while loop to test if parameters are taken into account (it works well the second time if not on the first time)...</li>
<li>I already encountered a lot of issues with this chip, related to timing between transactions, power on, etc... mostly when it comes to configure chip or store to NV storage</li>

<li>PCA96xx: channels enum with more channels (starting at 0)</li>
<li>PCA96xx: optimized code with channel enum values, other refactoring and more functions</li>
<li>PCA9624: setter added for register auto incrementation options (set to auto-increment over all registers as default for consistency with most of components included in the library / common handling behavior)</li>
<li>PCA9624: set all channels to dimmable mode in default init sequence</li>
<li>PCA9624: added setters for MODE1 &amp; MODE2 registers as inlines (consistancy especially for MODE2 which have some reserved bits values for proper operation)</li>
<li>PCA9685: possible handling of external clock and computation of prescaler and frequency modified</li>
<li>PCA9685: functions to compute frequency/prescaler for outputs frequency rationalization with PCA9532 functions</li>
<li>PCA9685: Refactoring and changes to handle PCA9685 outputs shifting (delay on)</li>
